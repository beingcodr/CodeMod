In the realm of web development, there are 3  main technologies\n\n1. HTML \n2. CSS \n3. JS\n\nWith additional features rolling out every day, mastering technology is impossible. I suggest you learn enough that you can create a layout on your own. \n\nType `/resources` to get all resources\n\nAnd many more if you search on Google. If you ask me I would suggest you learn the basics from Codecademy they have better UI and some of the visual examples clears your doubts \n\nAfter learning the basics move to FreeCodeCamp and learn some intermediate stuff that wasn't covered in Codecademy.",

Login and search for beautiful modern layouts and try to recreate them applying all the knowledge you learnt till now.\n\nYou're bound to be stuck in the hell of errors and/or your layouts won't line up the way they should. Use the 2 most widely used search engines Google and YouTube to find StackOverflow solutions and tutorial videos to solve your problems.\n\nIf you still don't find a solution, post your issue in this group. While posting an issue you need help with. Describe the issue in detail with screenshots and/or share code on GitHub\n\nWhen you're confident enough to recreate any type of UI layout with HTML & CSS.
